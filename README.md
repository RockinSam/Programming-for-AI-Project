# Programming-for-AI-Project
Final Project for Programming for Artificial Intelligence by Group E from MSc Artificial Intelligence of National College of Ireland.

### Steps to run the Code Artefact File.

#### Cloning the repository:
1. Install git on your computer.
2. Run the command prompt as administrator in a desired path.
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/RockinSam/Programming-for-AI-Project.git` in the command prompt.
4. Or go to https://github.com/RockinSam/Programming-for-AI-Project and download zip file of the repository.

#### Creating the virtual environment:
1. Install python on your computer.
2. Run command prompt as administrator and go to the repository path.
3. Run `python -m venv .venv` in the command prompt.
4. Run `.venv\scripts\activate` in the command prompt to activate the virtual environment.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the command prompt to install all required libraries.
6. Run the commands again if it is not working properly.
#### Setting up environment variables in `.env` file:
1. Recommended to open the repository folder (Programming-for-AI-Project) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new file `.env` in the repository folder.
3. Copy the `MONGDB_URL` and `MONGODB_DBNAME` values given in the project report in the `.env` file and save.
#### Running the `code_aretefact.ipynb` file:
1. Open the `code_artefact.ipynb` file in VS Code.
2. Go to 'Select Kernel' > 'Python Environments' > '.venv'.
3. Now click the 'Run All' button to run the file and see output.
